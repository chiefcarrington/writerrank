This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

From the repository root you can start a local development environment with the following commands:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd writerrank
npm install
# create a .env.local file and add the environment variables listed below
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the `writerrank` directory with the following variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<your-supabase-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your-supabase-anon-key>
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=<your-supabase-service-role-key>
RESEND_API_KEY=<your-resend-api-key>
CLERK_<...>=<clerk-values>
```

All `CLERK_*` variables are provided by Clerk and should be copied from your Clerk dashboard.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
